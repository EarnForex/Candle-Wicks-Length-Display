# Candle Wicks Length Display

Candle Wicks Length Display is a custom indicator for MT4 and MT5 coded by EarnForex.com. It was originally created as an alert indicator for abnormally long wicks (candle shadows), however, eventually it evolved into a highly customizable indicator capable of comfortably displaying candlestick wicks' lengths directly on the chart according to the trader's settings.

You can use it to detect market abnormalities (it supports all kinds of MetaTrader alerts) or to anticipate trend reversals.
